In this I was given a Packet Capture Next Generation(PCAPNG), is a file format used to store network packet data. I opeaned it with wireshark so
fiest I searched for some possible file like ,Flag, wired.Then I sorted the info abd saw that all the packets had a format so i just searched ang got a file gattacker.txt
i opened it in the liberoffice and got a hint of OSINT because it was indide {} but it was not the answer then i again looked again and found all hail king bluetooth 
i searched in the web and found the name Harald Bluetooth which was the flag.
